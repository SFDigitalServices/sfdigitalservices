        <p>Imagine a city where a teenager in the Bayview can search for a summer internship from his cell phone,
          allowing him to gain valuable job training for a future career. Or a family in the Mission can apply for
          health insurance from a computer at their local library. Or where an aspiring café owner can apply for and
          track every permit for her business from her home office.</p>
        <!-- <p>Digital services can make each of these scenarios a reality.</p> -->
        <p>San Francisco's Digital Services Strategy, published in 2016, seeks to make a dramatic shift in how we
          deliver services – to focus on you, our residents, visitors, and the businesses in the city we love. Digital
          services can make each of these scenarios a reality, but we recognize there's a lot of work to do! We're
          recruiting technologists to join our team: if you're a developer, designer, product manager, or content
          strategist who wants to use your skills for good, get in touch.</p>

        <li><strong>Digital By Default: </strong> Services should be delivered digitally whenever possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrated Service: </strong> Digital services should be managed by the core business, and not

        </li>
        <li><strong>Build Expertise: </strong> The City should establish a team with modern skills and support an
          agile development culture.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative Process: </strong> Development of City service standards should be collaborative and

    <p>This Digital Services Strategy is about transforming the customer experience of City services, making our
      services accessible and easy to use for everyone. With each new digital service we build, we must redesign it from
      the ground up, making it simpler and faster. We want you to feel confident that when you need something from the
      City, you can get it in an easy, seamless way.</p>
